    description: CSYCMS is a Fast, Simple, and Flexible, file-based content management system, knowledge base and static site generator for nodejs. It uses static Markdown files to serve the content which are pulled from public/private repos in github, bitcket, gitlab or any other git repository management service. It runs services that enables it to auto update itself and the content it serves. It follows similar principles to other flat-file CMS platforms, and allows you to use the structure of content files used in the most popular flat file cms but in nodejs. In addition to this, it allows you to host several sites in one instance (installation) of it, and allows you to search across as many of your sites as you please.
